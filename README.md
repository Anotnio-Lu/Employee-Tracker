## Approach
To build this application, we started by analyzing the requirements and identifying the necessary technologies to fulfill them. We chose Node.js as the runtime environment, Inquirer for the command-line interface, and MySQL for the database management system.

Next, we designed the database schema to store departments, roles, and employees, ensuring the necessary relationships and constraints were in place. We created the necessary tables and set up the database connection within the application.

After setting up the database, we focused on implementing the logic to handle user input. We utilized Inquirer to provide a user-friendly interface with options for viewing and managing the employee database. We implemented the functionality for each option, such as viewing departments, roles, and employees, as well as adding new departments, roles, employees, and updating employee roles.

Once the core functionality was implemented, we thoroughly tested the application to ensure it met the acceptance criteria and functioned correctly in different scenarios. We made any necessary adjustments to improve the user experience and handle potential errors.
